# Hey, I'm Intruder 👋

## About Me

I am a Bachelor of Technology student in Electronics and Computer Science from Mumbai, India. My interest in programming began well before my formal education, driven by curiosity and a desire to build small projects. It started with creating Minecraft plugins to enhance my own gameplay, which eventually led me to develop a strong interest in the underlying technologies.

I am currently most comfortable programming in:

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

I also have some experience with ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white) and ![C/C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2FC++-00599C?style=flat-square&logo=cplusplus&logoColor=white), but I am less comfortable with them due to limited hands-on project work compared to my primary languages.

I have worked as a freelancer with several notable clients on projects including full-stack web development, Android development, plugin development, and Discord bots. Coming from a multidisciplinary academic background, I have a good understanding of both hardware and software systems. In addition, I co-own a hosting service in India that provides game server hosting, web hosting, and bot hosting services.

**Currently Learning:**
- CUDA
- Electronics Designing

## 🚀 Projects I've Built

### Utilara
**Tech Stack:** Discord.js, Node.js, TypeScript

An all-in-one feature-rich Discord bot built on a freemium model. Instead of making users type commands, Utilara uses a GUI-based interface because honestly, who likes typing commands anyway?

**Features:**
- **Security First:** Anti-Nuking & Anti-Flooding protection with robust moderation tools
- **Quality of Life:** High-quality music player, giveaway system, commissions tracking, ticketing & suggestions systems
- **Smart Features:** Join-to-create voice chats, AI-powered welcomer, and reminders
- **User Experience:** GUI-driven interactions for a smoother experience

### MiniMC
**Tech Stack:** Java, Spigot/Paper, Redis, MySQL

A Minecraft server where I'm the sole developer and maintainer. Started this as a hobby project with 2 other co-owners who handle marketing and running costs while I tackle all the technical challenges.

This project has honestly been my biggest learning experience. Built several complex systems from scratch because existing plugins were either too slow or didn't exist:
- **Cross-server inventory synchronization** — Keep player inventories synced across multiple servers
- **Cross-server warping** — Seamless teleportation between different server instances  
- **Custom dungeon mechanics** — Advanced gameplay systems built from the ground up

The technical stack had to be optimized heavily since performance is critical for a smooth player experience. Code remains closed source for obvious reasons.

### Web Development Portfolio
**Tech Stack:** Astro, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js

Currently working on a project with **ConfrontAI** (not yet public), but here are some live websites I've built:

**Live Sites:**
- **[MiniMC](https://minimc.in)** — Main landing page for the Minecraft server
- **[Utilara](https://utilara.net)** — Discord bot landing page and dashboard
- **[Utilara Wiki](https://wiki.utilara.net)** — Documentation and knowledge base

Focused on building fast, responsive sites with clean UX. Each site is optimized for performance and mobile-first design.
